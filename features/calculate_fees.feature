Feature: Adding PTA instructors to the database

  As an administrator
  So that I can give students' parents the fees
  I want to be able to calculate student fees automatically based on the classes they are enrolled in

  Given PENDING I am on the register courses home page
  
Scenario: See total Fee calculated after registering to courses
  Given PENDING I am on the "Fall 2011" "Abby" Student page
  Then PENDING I should see a total fee of "115"
  And PENDING I should see a course fee of "100"

Scenario: New students should have a fee of zero
  Given PENDING I am on the "Fall 2011" Students home page
  And PENDING I follow "Add new Student"
  Then PENDING I should see a fee of 0
